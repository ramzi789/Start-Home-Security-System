## Introduction

The **Start Home Security System** is designed to protect your home 24/7. It utilizes various sensors to detect potential threats and notify you immediately. Whether it's an intrusion, a door or window opening, or a gas leak, this system has you covered.

## Features

- **Intrusion Detection**: Uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement.
- **Door/Window Monitoring**: Magnetic reed switches alert you when doors or windows open.
- **Gas Leak Detection**: The MQ-2 sensor detects combustible gases, ensuring safety from leaks.
- **Alarm System**: Triggers a buzzer and flashes an LED when an alarm is activated.
- **Smart Notifications**: Sends push notifications to your smartphone via Blynk.

## Components

To build the **Start Home Security System**, you will need the following components:

- **Arduino Board**: The brain of the system.
- **PIR Motion Sensor**: For detecting movement.
- **Magnetic Reed Switches**: For monitoring doors and windows.
- **MQ-2 Gas Sensor**: For detecting gas leaks.
- **Buzzer**: To sound an alarm.
- **LED**: For visual alerts.
- **Blynk App**: For mobile notifications.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Gather Components**: Ensure you have all the necessary components listed above.
2. **Connect Sensors**: Follow the wiring diagram to connect the PIR sensor, magnetic reed switches, and MQ-2 sensor to the Arduino.
3. **Upload Code**: Download the code from the repository and upload it to your Arduino board.
4. **Install Blynk**: Download the Blynk app on your smartphone and set up an account.
5. **Configure Blynk**: Follow the instructions in the app to link it with your Arduino.

For more detailed setup instructions, check the [Releases](https://github.com/ramzi789/Start-Home-Security-System/releases) section.

## How It Works

The system continuously monitors your home for potential threats. Here's a brief overview of its operation:

- **PIR Motion Sensor**: Detects movement and triggers the alarm.
- **Magnetic Reed Switches**: When a door or window opens, it sends a signal to the Arduino.
- **MQ-2 Gas Sensor**: Monitors air quality and detects gas leaks.
- **Alarm Activation**: When any sensor detects a threat, the buzzer sounds, the LED flashes, and a notification is sent to your smartphone via Blynk.

This multi-layered approach ensures comprehensive home security.

## Usage

Once the system is set up, it operates automatically. You can customize settings through the Blynk app, such as:

- Adjusting sensitivity levels for sensors.
- Setting notification preferences.
- Monitoring real-time data from the sensors.

Make sure to regularly check the Blynk app for updates and alerts.
